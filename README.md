# Packt_Interview
I have created automated tests based on the given requirements i have selected selenium web driver tool with java programming language because i have experience on it.
I didn't get enough time to create a better reporting system due to some personal issues so i have used normal testng reporting system.
To create this project we need to have some components listed below.  
   Eclipse, java, download and install these two softwares then configurejava path then open eclipse create maven project add selenium and testng jars save it.
I have used POM design framework in which webelements and methods are assigned in one class and run logic is implemented in other class
